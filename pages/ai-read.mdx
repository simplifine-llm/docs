## How to Use AI While Reading  

The AI interface, accessible on the **right side of the screen**, allows you to:  

### 1. **Run Complex Numerical Analyses**  
- Simplifine’s AI can write and execute code directly within the app to perform numerical or data-driven analyses.  
- **Example:**  
  - **Query:** "Can you convert this data table into a time graph using Python?"  
  - **Result:** The AI will generate a Python script, execute it, and display the resulting graph.  

---

### 2. **Explore References and Find More Information**  
- Highlight specific text or references in a document to search for more details online or within your library.  
- **Example:**  
  - **Query:** "Can you find the papers this paragraph references and add them to my library with the 'To be read' tag?"  
  - **Result:** AI will identify the referenced works, locate them, and organize them in your library.

### 3. **Apply Methodologies to Your Data**  
- Select a section describing a methodology or procedure and ask the AI to simulate or adapt it to your own dataset.

- **Example:**  
  - **Query:** "Can you simulate this method on the dataset for the EEG readings?"  
  - **Result:** AI will analyze your dataset and apply the described methodology, providing a detailed output.

### 4. **Conduct Web Searches**  
- Use AI to quickly gather information from the web while reading.  
- **Example:**  
  - **Query:** "How did this intervention affect the local communities in the local news?"  
  - **Result:** AI will retrieve relevant web articles and summarize their findings.  

---

### 5. **Analyze the Paper**  
- Ask AI to critically analyze the paper for potential biases or limitations.  
- **Example:**  
  - **Query:** "What are the potential biases in this study?"  
  - **Result:** AI will review the study and provide a detailed analysis of possible biases and areas for further scrutiny.
