# **Simplifine Workspace**

The Simplifine interface is designed for smooth navigation, enabling you to manage files, collaborate with AI agents, and organize your notes efficiently. **Workspace** is the interface that you see first when you log in. It is composed of five primary components, each supporting different stages of your research process:


## **Sidebar**

**Sidebar** is your primary navigation hub, providing access to **Project Space**, **Library**, **Notebook**, and **Settings**. Use it to switch between sections effortlessly and maintain an organized workflow.

## **Project Space**&#x20;

**Project Space** is where you manage your Projects, acting as dedicated workspaces where all files, notes, and resources for each research endeavor are housed. Here you can create, edit, delete, and open your Projects.

  * <u>deleting files</u> to streamline your workspace
  * <u>organizing files</u> into folders, adding descriptions, and updating metadata to keep everything accessible.
